Q2. First Repeating element

Problem Description
Given an integer array A of size N, find the first repeating element in it.

We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurrence is the smallest.

If there is no repeating element, return -1.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the first repeating element.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
Input 2:

 A = [6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120]


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 -1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 5 is the first element that repeats
Explanation 2:

 There is no repeating element, output -1


Q3. Largest Continuous Sequence Zero Sum

Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers.

Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 106

-107 <= A[i] <= 107



Input Format
Single argument which is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return an array denoting the longest continuous sequence with total sum of zero.

NOTE : If there are multiple correct answers, return the sequence which occurs first in the array.



Example Input
A = [1,2,-2,4,-4]


Example Output
[2,-2,4,-4]


Example Explanation
[2,-2,4,-4] is the longest sequence with total sum of zero.


Q4. Sub-array with 0 sum

Problem Description
Given an array of integers A, find and return whether the given array contains a non-empty subarray with a sum equal to 0.

If the given array contains a sub-array with sum zero return 1, else return 0.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000

-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9



Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.



Output Format
Return whether the given array contains a subarray with a sum equal to 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input 2:

 A = [4, -1, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 0
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 No subarray has sum 0.
Explanation 2:

 The subarray [-1, 1] has sum 0.


Q5. Shaggy and distances

Problem Description
Shaggy has an array A consisting of N elements. We call a pair of distinct indices in that array a special if elements at those indices in the array are equal.

Shaggy wants you to find a special pair such that the distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. If there is no special pair in the array, then return -1.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105



Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return one integer corresponding to the minimum possible distance between a special pair.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [7, 1, 3, 4, 1, 7]
Input 2:

A = [1, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Here we have 2 options:
1. A[1] and A[4] are both 1 so (1,4) is a special pair and |1-4|=3.
2. A[0] and A[5] are both 7 so (0,5) is a special pair and |0-5|=5.
Therefore the minimum possible distance is 3.
Explanation 2:

Only possibility is choosing A[1] and A[2].
